# Ehland

A little map for Dungeon Siege 1.

This was my first completed Dungeon Siege map. It features two regions, one quest, and various NPCs (among others, a magic shop, a smith shop, a mule seller, and a companion). It's basically a demo map for the main elements a map needs, plus proof-of-concept for some creative use of terrain.

The map is set in Ehland, a handful of islands floating in the sky. Lord Hovart is threatening the quaint village of Eh, and you are asked to help. You have to get a little training in the woods before confronting him, and find a treasure to afford good equipment. You reach about level 5. The map features impossible geometry: regions stitched in a loop, and a tunnel through mid-air that is not visible from outside.

The map is NOT intended to fit into DS lore. It makes no sense that Lord Hovart is buried in Ehland. Please ignore.


## Installation

Simply put the .dsmap file in the Maps folder and the .dsres files in the Resources folder. Or put them all in the DSLOA folder if you use DSLOA.
